Counter examples generated by the tool zlscheck for ARCH20 friendly competition. The counter-examples can be found in subfolders of `bench_results`. The counter-examples in these folders can be validated in MATLAB using Simulink and S-TALIRO thanks to `validate_all.m`. You need to download S-TALIRO first and put it in the MATLAB path. The folder `shared` contains the MATLAB models used as benchmarks and matlab validation utilities used by `validate_all.m`.
